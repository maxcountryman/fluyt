## Installation
Fluyt is on Clojars. Add it as a dependency in your `project.clj` like so:

```clojure
:dependencies [[fluyt "0.1.0-SNAPSHOT"] ...]
```

## Usage
Fluyt uses core.async channels to pass around normalized `goog.net.XhrIo`
responses. To use these in a synchronous manner, the requests namespace
provides a `request` wrapper.

Example usage:

```clojure
(ns my-app.core
  (:require [fluyt.requests :as requests]))

;; read the resp off the channel
(go (prn (<! (requests/get "http://example.com/"))))

;; or pass in a handler fn
(defn handler [resp] (prn resp))
(requests/get "http://example.com/" {:handler handler})
```

## License
Fluyt is released under the MIT license, see LICENSE for further details.
